# SafeChat

## The messaging app that keeps you safe from prying eyes.

Our team of 3 developers quickly put together a model for a chat application that allows for a desktop version of snapchat-styled conversation where sensitive conversations can be quickly hidden from non-participants. It is designed to blend into the normal desktop-work space, allowing for a more professional presence when discussing confidential matters. Conversations are hidden and replaced with decoy chat by toggling views with the 'esc' key. 

Look for the 2.0 soon under the name Confyd! Features will include private rooms, invitations, and options for saving/deleting conversations.
